[![Schematic](./kicad/schematic.svg)](./kicad/schematic.pdf)

This is a small breakout board for the STM32F030F4P6 microcontroller,
containing:

 - A LDO, alternatively a 1117-3.3 or a MCP1700-3302 (or compatible)
 - 6 LEDs, one as a power LED, the other 5 controllable by the controller
 - A reset and a freely available pushbutton
 - A micro-SD slot
 - A 0.05 inch grid prototyping field


## Demo projects

The subfolder `demo` contains some example code snippets for a quick start. Each
contains the necessary makefile for building and flashing, so no IDE has to be
installed in order to get started. However, the makefile is currently only
tested on linux.


### Building, dependencies

The build requires `arm-none-eabi-binutils` and the
[STM32CubeF0](http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef0.html) firmware
package for the necessary CMSIS header files. Its location must be set in
`demo/config.mk`. After editing this file, please run

```
$ git update-index --skip-worktree demo/config.mk
```

if you plan on contributing to this repository. This command tells git to ignore
your changes to the file. Thus, the remote repository will always have the
default configuration file and there will no conflicts for everyone else pulling
the newest commits.


### Flashing and debugging

The makefile currently supports two methods of flashing the controller: Either
[texane's st-link](https://github.com/texane/stlink) or OpenOCD can be used.
OpenOCD also allows debugging, so if the makefile detects a running OpenOCD
instance, it will automatically upload the firmware via OpenOCD. If there's
none running, it will fall back to `st-flash`.

Each project directory includes a OpenOCD script, so you just have to start
OpenOCD like:

```
$ openocd -f flash.cfg
```

As a matter of debugging, only text messages via semihosting are implemented so
far. These are displayed in OpenOCD. See the `debug-print` example for details.
Apart from that, of course `arm-none-eabi-gdb` or a complete IDE can be used.
